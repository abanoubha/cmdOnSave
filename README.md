# cmdOnSave

- use in-project `.onsave.config` file to add the command(s) you want to run on save.
- you can run a specific command on save for each file type, or you can run command(s) after saving any file in the current project.

It is __not__ like [emeraldwalk's runOnSave](https://github.com/emeraldwalk/vscode-runonsave).
